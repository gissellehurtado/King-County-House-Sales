# King County House Sales

### Project Overview

This data visualization project aims to provide insights to the King County house sales using an interactive dashboard with a calendar widget as the main filter and multiple visuals including a line chart, histograms, a map, and a heatmap. In this dashboard, you can actively interact with the dashboard using the filters to the left and see things such as house prices based on the date, year they were built, square footage, what the average price is per zip code, price per condition and view, and number of bedrooms/bathrooms.
